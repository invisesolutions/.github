## Hi there 👋
We are Invise Solutions, a technology company in Orem, Utah. We provide IT services & computer repair solutions. Through our day-to-day business we come up with all sorts of ideas for coding and automating things. You may see many projects here in the coming months. We also believe in transparency, even if we the projects themselves are nothing more than open source code, it creates a fundamental priciple of what and who we are. We have nothing to hide, so we welcome anyone who is interested to investigate our code for themselves.
>“If we have the truth, it cannot be harmed by investigation. If we have not the truth, it ought to be harmed.”
